#A look at some statistics from key players in their playoff-ending series. The visuals are clear, but I want to highlight a few key observations

1) MPJ - as a scorer in the OKC series - was horrible. In Away games, he shot 2/20 (10%) from 3.
This could be attributed to OKC's defense, his shoulder injury (although his 3FG% was much higher vs LAC, post-shoulder injury), or he just had a poor series. 
As the third-best scorer on his team, they definitely needed more from him. Jokic (and Aaron Gordon) still taking OKC to 7 is impressive

2) Jayson Tatum doesn't deserve all the criticism he receives. 
He's a volatile 3-point shooter with a wide range of outcomes and definitely needs to go in the paint more when the 3 isn't falling, but everywhere else - he's a stud.
He only had one bad game against the NYK.

3) ANT is still too inconsistent. His +/-, scoring, and shooting percentages are volatile. 
He finds a way to support through rebounds and assists pretty consistently but needs to be more effective as a scorer. 
He shot 21% from 3 in Away games - both against LAL and OKC. That's not good enough when you're the 1.
